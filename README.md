# Rxeactions

Rxeactions is a digital journal that allows users to privately track medications theyâ€™ve been prescribed as well as side effects, thoughts, and feelings associated with those medications.

## Installation & Setup

Fork the [rxeactions repo](https://github.com/meg-gutshall/rxeactions) and clone it down to your computer. In the terminal, `cd` to the rxeactions root folder. Run `bundle install` to load the required Ruby gems and dependencies. Then type in `rake db:migrate` to create a new database from the migration tables stored under `db/migrate`. Type `rake db:seed` if you'd like to pre-populate the app with seed data.

## Usage

To deploy the Rxeactions web app locally, type `shotgun` into your terminal and open your browser to `localhost:9393`. From there, you'll be able to navigate and interact with the app as if it were live. Don't forget to return to your terminal and type `Ctrl + C` to stop your session when you're done!
