# Features to Implement in My App

## All Models

- [ ] Add validations directly into my models. Check for presence, `email` uniqueness, `password` length, etc.

## MedicationsController & ReactionsController

- [ ] Wrap my edit and delete form routes in conditional statements for an extra layer security to ensure that only the user who created the medication can access these routes for their own medications.

## All Forms

- [ ] Use nested hashes.

## Login & Signup Forms

- [ ] Link login form to signup form and vice versa in case the user navigated to the wrong page.

## New User Signup Form

- [ ] Use [this validation](http://html5pattern.com/Emails) in the input field for my email.

## New Medications Form

- [ ] Use [this PDF](http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/sites/default/files/downloads/Dosage_forms.pdf) to create a dropdown list to select a `dosage_form`.
