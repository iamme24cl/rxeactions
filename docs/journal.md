Was kind of slacking off until now. I had an idea of what I wanted to do but I couldn't really formulate it and after that Fwitter lab I just lost all of my drive. First thing this morning I had a chat with DJ and was able to get a few questions answered that helped me feel more secure in the direction I'll be going with this.

Some definitely issues I forsee though come to when the users edit their medications. A user may need to change the medication dosage or usage instructions according to their doctor so I want their reactions up until that change to be associated with the original medication record, not the edited one. I still have to figure out how to go about this and will probably speak with Howard and/or Ryan for help on it. Or I could reach out to Avi!
