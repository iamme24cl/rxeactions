    <p>On the home page, either sign up for an account or log in to your existing account.</p>
    <h4 id="user-dashboard">User Dashboard</h4>
    <p>Upon login or successful registration, you will be redirected to your user dashboard. The right-hand column displays your user details as entered in the signup form along with the option to edit these details by clicking the blue edit button. Below this is a list of your current medications with a few details about each medication. Click on the name of the medication to visit its detail page. In the left-hand column is a form to create a new medication. Upon completing the new medication form, you will be redirected to that medication's detail page.</p>
    <h4 id="medication-detail">Medication Detail Page</h4>
    <p>On the medication detail page you can see all the information submitted through the new medication form. If you left the "Usage Start Date", "Usage End Date", or "Prescribing Doctor" fields blank (as they were not required), they will not appear on the medication's detail page until you add the missing information via the edit button. <em class="req">Keep in mind that deleting a medication is different from stopping a medication.</em> To record that you've stopped taking a medication, you should use the edit button to change "Are you currently taking this medication?" to "No" and set a "Usage End Date". Only use the delete button if you wish to completely remove the medication and its associated reactions from your account. Once done, this action is irreversible.</p>
    <p>On the right-hand side underneath the medication details is a list of your reactions associated with this particular medication along with a few details about each reaction. Click on the reaction's title to visit its detail page. On the left-hand side is a form to record a new reaction. Upon completing the new reaction form, you will be redirected to that reaction's detail page.</p>
    <h4 id="reaction-detail">Reaction Detail Page</h4>
    <p>On the reaction detail page, you'll see the name of the medication the reaction is associated with followed by the title of the reaction. Below that will be an entry timestamp (as well as update if one was made to the reaction) and the body content of your recorded reaction. Following that are the dosage amount and usage instructions of the medication at the time you recorded your reaction and whether or not you're currently taking the medication. Further down you'll find edit and delete buttons as well as a button to return to the associated medication's detail page.</p>
    <h4 id="medications-list">Medications List</h4>
    <p>The medications list page displays a column of your current medications on the left and your previous medications on the right followed by all of your medications listed at the bottom. There is also a button in the upper right-hand corner to create a new medication which when clicked will take you to a full-page new medication form.</p>

    <p><strong class="req">Q:</strong> Can other people see my medications?
    <br><strong class="req">A:</strong> No. This app only allows users to view and edit medications that they themselves have created and it will automatically log them out if they try to access anyone else's information.</p>
    <p><strong class="req">Q:</strong> What if my dosage changes while I'm taking my medication?
    <br><strong class="req">A:</strong> You can easily change any information about your medication by navigating to that medication's detail page (either through your dashboard or through your list medications page) and clicking the "Edit Medication" button. Any changes you save will be immediately reflected on your medication detail page, however, they will not be reflected on previously recorded reactions, only on reactions recorded from this point forward. When there is a change to a medication, it is recommended that you record a reaction with an explanation of why that particular change was made.</p>
    <p><strong class="req">Q:</strong> Where can I find more information about my medication?
    <br><strong class="req">A:</strong> This app is purely for user's personal medical journaling purposes and is by no means qualified to give out medical advice, professional or otherwise. That being said, I am happy to direct users towards a few trusted resources:</p>

    <p>When I was in college, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Since then, I have changed psychiatrists several times and have added major depression and PTSD to my list of diagnoses. Over the course of the past decade, between seeking treatment from different doctors (each with their own preferred methods of therapy) and receiving new diagnoses, I've been on a LOT of different medications. Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you what most of them were, let alone the dosage.</p>
    <p>This is where the idea for Rxeactions stemmed from. When I would see a new psychiatrist and we would discuss which prescription(s) I would start taking, they would ask me for a history which I wouldn't be able to give them. I may be able to track down at least medications, dosages, and when I was taking them, but who wants to call a bunch of doctor's offices to track down their medical records? I don't! Other times, my psychiatrst would suggest a medication they had in mind to try for my treatment and I'd remember taking it before but not when, or for how long, or why I stopped it.</p>
    <p>I really wish I would have had the foresight at the time to write down my prescribed medications and associated experiences, but I didn't. With this app, it's no longer something I'll have to worry about and hopefully it will prevent the same regret I feel now for others who find themselves in a similar situation as mine.</p>

    <p>Hello! My name is Meg Gutshall and I live in the suburbs of Philly, the land of cheesesteaks and rowdy sports fans. I'm a proud graduate of Temple University's Spanish program and an even prouder student of Flatiron School's online software engineering program. When I'm not lost in coding a new program, my thoughts are hijacked by the latest book I'm reading, or I'll head to a brewery in search of the next great beer. And although I work from home, I have Pip my ever-faithful cat codepanion to keep me company and help make executive decisions.</p>
